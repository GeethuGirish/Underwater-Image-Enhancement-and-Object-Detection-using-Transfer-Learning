Underwater Image Enhancement and Object Detection using Transfer Learning

Underwater object detection is one of the active areas of research in the past decade. To study the marine life population and their adapting behaviours, it is essential to detect marine objects and classify them. Some of the challenges in marine object detection are: low visibility, increased noise, low contrast, blurred edges, black patches, and color deviation. The aim of this project is to explore and analyze transfer learning techniques to achieve this objective of detecting marine objects and classifying them. This project draws on the brackish dataset and uses two unique models:
Yolov4 and EfficientDet. Later, the results of the two techniques have been evaluated and compared with each other to draw some interesting insights.
